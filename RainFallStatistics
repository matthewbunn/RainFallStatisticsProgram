' Program Name: Rainfall Activity 2000-2015 Windows Application
' Author:       Matthew Bunn
' Date:         December 15, 2019
' Purpose:      The rainfall Windows Application uses a
'               text file that contains the 2000-2015 Rain
'               season statistics of named storms to find the
'               average number of storms during the time period and
'               to find the most active year.
